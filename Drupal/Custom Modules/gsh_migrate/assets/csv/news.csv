"3241","3244","""Boys Farm Cuts Ribbon for The Nieri House"" - The Newberry Observer","255","1","1540222648","1542210119","1","0","19288","<p><b>By Kelly Duncan - <a href=""mailto:kduncan@newberryobserver.com"">kduncan@newberryobserver.com</a></b></p>
<p>NEWBERRY — Over the weekend, Boys Farm held its 14th annual Fall Festival, the highlight of the festival was the ribbon cutting ceremony for Boys Farm’s newest house the ‘Nieri House.’</p>
<p>According to greatsouthernhomes.com the building is 6,712 square feet with nine bedrooms and offers needed additional space at the farm.</p>
<p>Development Director Andre Jennings said the new addition came to be a few years ago after Michael Nieri, president and founder of Great Southern Homes, approached Boys Farm wanting to get involved.</p>
<p>“Michael Nieri approached us a couple of years ago and said he wanted to be involved with Boys Farm and asked if he could help us out by building houses, so of course we said yes and he came out for a tour along with Building Industry Association of Central Midlands (BIA),” Jennings said.</p>
<p>Then, in 2014 Nieri along with BIA came out and built two houses at Boys Farm and last year Nieri approached Boys Farm wanting to do more. Thus began the process of building the Nieri House.</p>
<p>“We’re just excited that Michael Nieri and Great Southern Homes and his team have been so excited and so willing to help us out,” Jennings said.</p>
<p>Jennings added with the addition of the Nieri House, it will helps Boys Farm continue to serve needy boys.</p>
<p>“Boys Farm has been serving needy boys since the 60s and we believe we have a really good model of helping children and families in difficult situations and so this is going to expand out capacity by over 25 percent, this is a really important thing because in South Carolina there is still a big need for foster care type homes and this is not only helping us serve more children, but serve them in a much better situation,” he said.</p>
<p>The long term plan, Jennings said, is to add one more cottage for the boys.</p>
<p>“Who knows what we can do after that, we don’t want to grow too big, we definitely want to have a model that serves the boys, but doesn’t get so big that it becomes an institution, we want it to be a very family-oriented atmosphere,” he said.</p>
<p>Although the boys will have to wait a few more weeks before moving in, Jennings said they are thrilled about the new facility.</p>
<p>“The boys are thrilled, most of our facilities were built in the 70s and they require a lot of maintenance, so this new house, not only is the design very functional, it offers so much more living space for the children in the house, plenty of space for game opportunities, just an entire new living experience,” he said.</p>
<p>Mayor Foster Senn commended Nieri and Great Southern Homes for the new addition, saying that the Nieri House will benefit the boys for years to come.</p>
<p>“They (Boys Farm) take boys in difficult situations, brings them up in a positive, caring family environment, there’s a lot of love going on here at Boys Farm. On behalf of the City of Newberry and the Newberry community we also want to thank Michael Nieri of Great Southern Homes, what a beautiful home this is. Great Southern Homes you all know is one of the best and largest builders in the region, in 2017 they were named South Carolina Builder of the Year which is quite an accomplishment,” Senn said.</p>
<p>Nieri said it was a pleasure to work with Boys Farm and that they are excited for what the future holds.</p>
<p>“This has been a real pleasure working with Boys Farm and we’re excited about the future and we do plan on starting immediately to possibly start a fourth house very soon, we’re just scouting around trying to find a little piece of dirt to build another one,” he said.</p>

<h1>Still Mia: Devastating injury took GHS grad's mobility but not her spirit</h1>
<p>By Chris Sokoloski <a href=""mailto:csokoloski@southstrandnews.com"">csokoloski@southstrandnews.com</a></p>
<p>In many ways, Jamia Porcher is your typical 20-year-old.</p>
<p>She likes to hang out with her friends and watch her little sister play high school basketball, and she dreams of graduating from Clemson University. But the Georgetown High School graduate and S.C. Air National Guard veteran is far from typical.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/news/Mia%20Sophomore%20Pic.jpg"" style=""margin: 10px; float: right; width: 80px; height: 253px;"" /></p>
<p>Mia, as people call her, is a quadriplegic and must use a wheelchair since a devastating accident on June 7, 2016.</p>
<p>Mia was driving to McEntire Joint National Guard Base in Hopkins on that fateful night last year when she was nearly hit head-on by a truck that had drifted into her lane. Although she avoided the crash, she watched as the truck hit another vehicle.</p>
<p>After stopping to see if she could help, Mia was hit by a passing car.</p>
<p>“I kind of think about,"" Mia says, ""why did I stop, what made me stop?”</p>
<p>Michelle Annicchiarico, Mia’s mother, said when she first got the news about the accident, she was just thankful that her daughter was alive, but then the doctors told her that Mia probably wouldn’t survive.</p>
<p>When it became clear that Mia would survive, doctors told Michelle that her daugher would be on a ventilator for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>Mia said when she first woke up after the accident, she was “confused” and it was awhile before she realized how badly she was hurt.</p>
<p>For the first few months, she remained on a ventilator and had to wear a neck brace, but eventually she was able to breath on her own and since the accident, she has regained the ability to move her head. Some feeling and movement have also returned in her shoulders and the tops of her arms.</p>
<p>“I’ve gotten a lot stronger,” Mia said.</p>
<p>She lives with her mother and siblings in a rented mobile home in Georgetown. She said the hardest part of life is not having her independence, but her attitude is positive.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of help and a lot of support,” Mia said. “Things aren’t the easiest, but it could be worse.”</p>
<p>Mia and her mother both said the mobile home is not large enough or equipped for someone in a wheelchair.</p>
<p><img alt=""Mia Porcher"" src=""/sites/default/files/news/Mia%20Porcher.jpg"" style=""margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 500px; height: 666px;"" /></p>
<p>“I wish she could have a little bit more independence as far as … adaptive (equipment),” Michelle said. “We have limited space. I just want her to keep as much independence as she can. I want her to be comfortable.”</p>
<p>Three days a week, Mia travels to Roper St. Francis Rehabilitation Hospital in Charleston for therapy, including weight-bearing and muscle-memory exercises. Therapists also connect electrodes to her muscles to try and make them stronger. She also has in-home therapy.</p>
<p>“Just trying to get back whatever she can get back consumes our days,” her mother said.</p>
<p>Mia said she doesn’t give a lot of thought to what medical advances or cures there might be in the future. For now, she’s just working to help herself.</p>
<p>When not at therapy or hanging out with friends, Mia loves to watch her sister, Arian Lance, and cousins play basketball. She was a regular fixture at Arian’s Georgetown High basketball games and Georgetown County Parks and Recreation games.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/news/Mia%20Attends%20Georgetown%20High.jpg"" style=""margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 585px; height: 439px;"" /></p>
<p>“I still love it,” she said.</p>
<p>“She’s still active. She still keeps in touch with all of her friends,” Michelle said and adding that her daughter ""keeps me going.”</p>
<p>Tony Ford coached Mia at Georgetown High.</p>
<p>“She can’t do the things she used to do, but she’s still Mia,” Tony said. “I love that. She’s still got that attitude.”</p>
<p>The coach recalled how Mia was an honor roll student, very smart and very “strong-minded.”</p>
<p>“She had a powerful attitude,” he added.</p>
<p>When Mia was a senior and Arian was an eighth-grader, the coach promoted Arian to the varsity squad so the sisters could play together. One day he found the girls playing a one-on-one game in the gym and Mia was “banging” on Arian. He said at first he wondered why Mia was being so tough, but then he realized she was just trying to make her sister better.</p>
<p>Before the accident, Mia had completed one year at Clemson, where she earned a spot on the Dean’s List. She plans to return to school in August to finish her degree in business management.</p>
<p>Her mother said she's confident that Mia will graduate from Clemson.</p>
<p>Mia’s long-term goal is still to own her own business one day. In 10 years, she sees herself “hopefully back to normal and back to my career goals (and) more independent and more back to where I was before the accident.”</p>
<p>Mia’s uncle, Thomas Lance, has organized a #Miastrong Committee of friends and family members to raise money to get Mia and her family into a “smart” home with voice-activated equipment and appliances. Committee members meet frequently to plan fundraisers.</p>
<p>The first event on March 11 will be a co-ed alumni basketball game at Georgetown High featuring a team of graduates from Carvers Bay, Pleasant Hill and Choppee high schools vs. a team of graduates from Howard, Winyah and Georgetown high schools.</p>
<p>Thomas is also planning a skills competition that day, including three-point shooting and slam dunk contests, for current high school players.</p>
<p>Mia, her mom and Thomas said they've been touched by the outpouring of community support.</p>
<p>“Everybody does this in their free time,"" Mia said. ""It shows they care, and I’m really appreciative of what they’re doing. I’m thankful.”</p>
<p>“It just makes me feel great,” her mother said. “She’s just a great kid. It makes me proud.”</p>
<p>And her uncle adds, “It shows that people still care. Everybody wants to help.” He's also started a gofundme.com account to collect donations. People can also send a check to P.O. Box 6, Georgetown SC 29440.</p>
<p>For more information on helping Mia or participating in the alumni game, call Thomas at 843-485-7195 or Keith Moore at 843-344-0859.</p>

"3242","3245","Great Southern Homes Mike Satterfield Is An Industry Heavy Hitter","255","1","1539359329","1542212451","1","0","19289","<p><strong>By Vincent Harris, Columbia Business Monthly</strong></p>
<p>COLUMBIA, SC — When Mike Satterfield accepted the position of CEO for Great Southern Homes in 2013, he brought more than 30 years of home-building experience with him. Since then, he has helped the company grow year after year.</p>
<p>In July, Satterfield was honored by the South Carolina Home Builders Association, which gave him their annual Thomas N. Bagnal Builder Member of the Year award. The award honored not just his success in the home-building industry, but his commitment to community service. That service follows in the footsteps of the award’s namesake who passed away in 2011.</p>
<p>Bagnal was a charter member of the Home Builders Association of Greater Columbia in 1958 and a two-term president. He left behind a reputation as an exemplary businessman who also served his community, including a 12-year stint on the Richland County Planning Commission.</p>
<p>Satterfield hopes that he won this award because there’s a little bit of Bagnal in the way he conducts himself.</p>
<p>Under Satterfield’s leadership, along with Founder Michael Nieri, Great Southern homes has raised money and built residency cottages for the Boys Farm of Newberry, a group that helps boys who are experiencing difficult family situations, and donated to Camp Cole, special gathering place for purpose driven groups.The company also raises money for the Building Industry Charitable Foundation, which helps a variety of organizations and individuals.</p>
<p>“I knew Mr. Bagnal. He was a great guy. If you ask around, you won’t find anybody that says a bad word about him,” says Satterfield, who is also the current president of the Building Industry Association of Central South Carolina. “It was kind of odd when I received this award because 25 years ago I was at a roast in his honor, and I asked my girlfriend, who is now my wife, ‘I wonder what a guy has to do to get to that level?’</p>
<p>“I always wanted to leave a mark, to try to run a business where you do the right thing and you treat people the way you’d like to be treated, and maybe then I’d be in a position to receive an award like that,” Satterfield adds. “So maybe the fact that I wondered if something like that could happen to me put me on a path to being a man like Tom Bagnal.”</p>
<p>It will be a while before we know the scope of Satterfield’s legacy and if it compares to Bagnal’s, but he’s definitely made a mark on Great Southern Homes.</p>
<p>The Columbia company was founded by Nieri in 2004 and specialized in entry-level product for the first time home buyer.. It was a successful model for two decades or so, but the company was still hurting from the 2008 recession when Satterfield came on board, bringing a wealth of hands-on experience with him.</p>
<p>“If you look up ‘on-the-job training’ in Webster’s dictionary, you’re going to see my picture,” he says with a laugh. “I graduated high school but didn’t go to college, and I got into home building at the ripe old age of 19. I spent 10 years building apartments, then 20 years with Centex homes here in the Midlands. For the last eight years I was there, I was the division president over Columbia and Greenville. At that time, we were one of the largest developer-builder companies under one roof.”</p>
<p>After his 20 years at Centex, Satterfield decided to move into semi-retirement, building five or six custom homes a year, but mostly hunting and fishing. But that life of relative leisure didn’t last long.</p>
<p>“I had to work at not working,” he says. “After running a big operation and being driven by that, it didn’t work well for me. I’d find myself in a deer stand at three in the afternoon thinking that was what I’d wanted to do, but then feeling guilty because I felt like I should be working somewhere. I wanted to get back in the game without giving up where I lived.”</p>
<p>That was around 2013, when Nieri came calling.</p>
<p>“One of my suppliers told me that Michael wanted to talk to me,” Satterfield says. “I went and sat down with him, and the direction he wanted to take the company was different from where they’d been. They were at an entry-level home building level, and I come from more of an environment where you build multiple products in multiple price points in multiple market segments. We agreed that that was the path he wanted his company to go with and it was a good fit for me, so we gave it a go.”</p>
<p>Bringing some of his crew from the Centex days, Satterfield revamped Great Southern Homes with a new strategy.</p>
<p>“They were focused on very entry-level homes, and it’s hard to make them attractive,” he says. “So the goal was to create a product that had curb appeal, but to use the technology that’s out there today to provide the efficiency people want. If you can’t get a potential customer out of the car, you’re not going to sell them a house. So we tried to create curb appeal with our product and add the tech that’s important to the buyer.”</p>
<p>Under Satterfield, Great Southern Homes radically expanded their home-building approach, creating everything from duplexes for around $125,000 to single-family homes for $350,000-$400,000 to million-dollar custom-built houses.</p>
<p>The result was a stunning period of growth in a still-recovering market.</p>
<p>“In 2013, I can tell you we sold about 250 homes,” Satterfield says. “This year, I’m projecting that we’ll sell 1,150. In 2013, we weren’t on anybody’s radar, and by 2016, we were the 62nd largest builder in the country. I hope to break 60th this year. The growth has been off the chain.</p>
<p>“We’ve now got properties in Greenville, Spartanburg, Pickens County, and Anderson County, along with Augusta, Ga. We’ve stretched all over the state, and we’ve averaged 30 percent growth every year.”</p>
<p>But how much of that success came from Satterfield’s strategy, and how much came from the economy’s gradual recovery?</p>
<p>“I think it’s both,” he says. “The market rebounded from the recession, but there were fewer builders, so the opportunity to get more was certainly there. The timing was right."" </p>
<p>Satterfield adds, ""We have a great group of people because we were able to pick the best of the best. We’ve been very fortunate in this market.”</p>

<p>(NEWBERRY, SC) - The Midlands children's home, Boys Farm of Newberry will welcome a third residency cottage named “The Nieri Family Cottage” on October 13, 2018.  A ribbon-cutting will be held at 2:00 PM.  President and founder of Great Southern Homes, Michael Nieri volunteered to build the cottage on behalf of the Building Industry Association of Central Midlands (“BIA”) with support from the BIA’s Charitable Foundation. “We are honored to help accommodate the growing needs of children to have a safe home and give them hope for generations to come,” said Nieri.</p>
<p>In recognition of Nieri’s previous contributions and his commitment to build the cottage, the Boys Farm named it in honor of his family. The Nieri Family Cottage is a state-of-the-art building that provides housing for the boys, house parents and their families.  It provides 6,712 square feet under roof with 9 bedrooms, offering much-needed additional space for boys living at the farm. This is the third Boys Farm cottage built by Great Southern Homes. Each building is a large, spacious home with modern kitchens, media rooms, and the latest in energy-savings technologies to reduce power costs.  </p>
<p>Boys Farm will cut the ribbon during its Newberry Fall Festival and BBQ Fundraiser where it celebrates its long mission of service. The Boys Farm residency program provides structured and caring new beginnings for youth in a pastoral and Christian setting with a mission of “Building Boys Rather Than Mending Men.” Festivities for the Fall Festival on October 13 begin at 11 am and run till 4 o'clock. There will be all kinds of great kids friendly activities and a plate of delicious BBQ will sell for $8.</p>
<p>""This is a great community-service type project that we can provide.  It's what we do best… building great homes,"" said Michael Nieri, owner of Great Southern Homes. ""We build houses for people and this was a great cause to take on."" BIA President Mike Satterfield also shared, “Our organization represents many caring businesses in Central South Carolina that will help build a better community by offering donations of materials, money and labor toward the construction of this special home for boys and their house parents allowing them to live in a structured family environment.”</p>
<p>Boys Farm is a nonprofit organization that provides unique foster care services for boys experiencing difficult family situations and is located at 6655 SC Highway 34/121 in Newberry, SC. Donations in support of the Nieri Family Cottage continue to be accepted by the BIA, a SC nonprofit 501 (c) (3) organization affiliated with the Building Industry Association, 625 Taylor Street, Columbia, SC, or to Boys Farm, Inc, a SC nonprofit 501 (c) (3) organization, PO Box 713, Newberry, SC, 29108.</p>

<p><em>by Susan Roush</em></p>
<p><strong>Nimble and forward thinking are words used to describe Michael Nieri, founder and owner of Great Southern Homes, based in Irmo, SC. Mike Satterfield, EVP/CEO of Great Southern Homes, shared some background: Great Southern Homes was building 500-600 homes per year prior to the recession. To survive the downturn, the company slimmed down to 15 employees. Mike said, “Not many privately held companies made it through the downturn; that was one of the things that I was intrigued about.”</strong></p>
<p>Before Mike joined Great Southern Homes in 2013, he had risen up the ranks of housing giant Centex and was the Division President of the Central South Carolina division before he went into semi-retirement in 2005, “Not knowing the world was coming to an end.” He continued, “In my Centex days we were typically number one or two in our markets. My goal was to see if I could manage a privately-held company and get it back to the same dominant position in the markets that Centex held. He and Michael called their effort the “putting the band back together” campaign. Mike added, “We have been able to assemble a really special group of people, and that’s been a key part of our growth.”</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/news/coastal-news-2.jpg"" style=""float: right; width: 480px; height: 318px; margin-left:2em; margin-bottom:2em;"" />In 2013, the company sold 180 houses in the Midlands of SC. Since then, Great Southern Homes achieved a 38% to 40% growth year-over-year. In 2017, they sold 838 houses and project to have 1200 + sales in 2018. Their markets include the Midlands, the Upstate, Florence, Aiken, coastal South Carolina [Charleston & Myrtle Beach] and Augusta, GA. Mike recalled, “In 2013 we weren’t on anybody’s radar.” Three years later the company was ranked the 62nd largest homebuilder by Builder Magazine and the 3rd fastest-growing, privately-held builder in the country. A large part of the company’s success has been driven by attracting quality people, choosing the best markets for growth and product diversification.</p>
<p>A key member of the team is Keith Harris, Coastal Division Manager. Keith said, “In 2016 we expanded to the coast. In Myrtle Beach our first venture was a 7-lot infill project in Murrells Inlet called Sterling Pointe.” The initial reaction was favorable as their Preston model won the New Home Parade Design Award for homes in the $240K to $270K price range. Two other experienced builders have joined Keith as Project Managers in the Coastal Division.</p>
<p>Jack Webb is the project manager for Champions Village, Ocean Lakes, and an oversight manager for a townhouse development in Charleston. Jack was a self-employed custom homebuilder for 17 years and has worked with other production builders in Myrtle Beach. He said, “I wouldn’t go back into business for myself. I would rather work for Great Southern; they treat everyone with total respect – employees and customers. They build energy-efficient homes and stand behind their products. Michael Nieri is willing to take chances and do things differently.”</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/news/coastal-news-5.jpg"" style=""margin: 0px 2em 2em 0px; float: left; width: 350px; height: 424px;"" />Harry Dill is the Project Manager for Litchfield Breezes, Pawleys Sunset, Waterway Palms, and Wild Wing Plantation. He said, “I’ve been a builder here on the beach since 1989.” Some readers may remember Harry Dill from the Extreme Makeovers he managed in Horry Country. He has been active with HGHBA for years, including serving as past president at state and local levels. Harry said, “I can attribute a lot of my success to the HBA. We have to support our industry in order for our industry to support us.”</p>
<p>Keith Harris provided a synopsis of current projects in the Grand Strand. The 2018 Parade of Homes will include Great Southern Homes in Champions Village and Pawleys Sunset. Keith noted, “There’s value in what we do with features not typical of other volume builders. We have a Green Smart home package with a two-year energy guarantee, beefed up insulation, and standard home automation with the Honeywell Lyric system.”</p>
<hr />
<h4><a href=""https://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/communities/champions-village"">Champions Village</a></h4>
<p>This 71-lot community is within the Prince Creek Community of Murrells Inlet. Situated along the finishing holes of the TPC course, there are interior and golf course lots and a private pool and amenity center. Homes start at 1,600 square feet; priced from $280’s. Champions Village received the Best in Residential Category from the Grant Center for Real Estate in the Economics Department at Coastal Carolina University.</p>
<h4><a href=""https://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/communities/pawleys-sunset"">Pawleys Sunset</a></h4>
<p>Located off the South Causeway on Pawleys Island, Great Southern Homes offers elevated traditional beach houses that are golf cart accessible to the beach. The raised beach houses are approximately 1,800 square feet, 4 BR / 4 BA, priced from the low $300’s. Currently there are 14 lots with 4 houses under construction.</p>
<h4><a href=""https://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/communities/wild-wing-plantation"">Wild Wing Plantation</a></h4>
<p>The company just received ARB approvals for four starts, including a furnished model home and three specs. Great Southern Homes acquired 21 lots total for homes starting at 2,200 square feet and priced from the low $300’s.</p>
<h4><a href=""https://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/communities/waterway-palms"">Waterway Palms</a></h4>
<p>This popular Carolina Forest community, with its superb amenity center, was an attractive draw for Great Southern. They purchased seven lots where they can work their infill magic. Keith said, “All of our houses have a master on the main level.” Square footage will run from 2,500 and prices start in the upper $370’s.</p>
<h4><a href=""https://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/communities/ocean-lakes"">Ocean Lakes</a></h4>
<p>This project reflects the owner’s nimble thinking. Great Southern Homes initially built three homes and have two more under construction. One is sold and two homes are for sale and are completely furnished and equipped for rental for $3,200 a week through Ocean Lakes Property Management. Jack said, “This wouldn’t be on other builders’ radar, because the land is leased, but it appeals to investors for the vacation rental potential.”</p>
<h4><a href=""https://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/communities/litchfield-breezes"">Litchfield Breezes</a></h4>
<p>In the heart of Litchfield Beach, the company acquired home-sites in the marsh front community of Litchfield Breezes. Featuring custom homes overlooking the marsh, the raised traditional homes range from 2,200 to 3,000 + square feet and the low $400’s in price. Keith said, “Our goals in 2018 are lot acquisition and developing our own positions. We understand that Realtors are an integral part of our business, and we appreciate what they do, and we try to make their job easy. You have to have a good partnership with all the people you work with and take care of the homeowners.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Two families that are very satisfied with Great Southern Homes are Suzanne and Julio Ortiz and Janis and Dan Blasiak. Both couples built in Champions Village.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/news/coastal-news-4.jpg"" style=""margin: 0px 0px 2em 2em; float: right; width: 480px; height: 318px;"" />Suzanne Ortiz said, “We decided on Champions Village in August 2016. We liked the location, and we loved the lot. We loved that it was a small community.” Julio added, “Grant (the Realtor) was phenomenal; he was with us every step of the way. Jack (Webb) the builder was incredibly patient with us. We had lots of questions and he kept answering. They went out of their way to make us part of the process.” Suzanne concurred, “I’ll be real honest with you, Jack was actually more observant than we were during the walk-through before the closing.” They started with a standard layout and Great Southern accommodated the floor plan changes they wanted. Julio said, “We were pretty picky about what we wanted. Trim out detail was really important to me.” He likes the double crown molding throughout, and the smart home package so they can control the house remotely. They are both delighted with the fully-finished garage. Suzanne summed up, “I just had a wonderful experience from beginning to end. I felt they wanted my business and they wanted to make me happy.”</p>
<p>Janis and Dan Blasiak moved from Oahu, so it was no surprise they felt there was tremendous value for a home in Champions Village. Dan said, “I wanted a house with certain features. We didn’t want vinyl siding, we wanted the ability to customize and not have a cookie-cutter house.” The Blasiaks opted for several upgrades but did not make any structural changes. “We were happy with the layout; it shows very well,” Dan said.</p>
<p>Like the Ortiz family, they were attracted to the size of Champions Village. Dan added, “We like the energy efficiency of the home. They went above and beyond to make sure this house was sealed tight. They actually brought in a third-party tester to make sure there weren’t any leaks in the house, and that it met certain criteria. I also like that it is an all gas home.” For Janis’s part, she is very content with her Great Southern Home and the way it came together. She laughed, “The next home is a pine box.”</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/news/coastal-news-3.jpg"" style=""margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em; float: left; width: 420px; height: 274px;"" />Since 2013, Great Southern Homes success has been most impressive. The company currently builds everything from single-family homes, town homes, custom homes and recently student housing communities. Corporately, they believe in giving back to the community. Michael and Mike hold positions with the Building Industry Association of Central SC (BIA) and strive to maintain healthy relations with competitors to address industry concerns. In 2017, they were both recognized with prestigious BIA awards for their contributions.</p>
<p>Great Southern Homes is a proud supporter of The Boys Farm in Newberry, SC. Two years ago, the company built two 5,000 square foot residency cottages on the Farm. This past year, the company broke ground on the “Nieri Cottage” project; a modern, energy-efficient structure with 6,700 square feet, 9 bedrooms and 9 bathrooms. The Boys Farm has signicantly modernized and expanded its capacity to house young men who have experienced difficult family situations. These young men benefit from living together on a working farm and developing social and success skills in the farm setting.</p>

"2264","2266","Why Buying a New Home is Better than a Fixer-Upper","245","1","1497538985","1497539982","1","0","6590","<p>Many first-time buyers and experienced home owners struggle with the decision to buy a new home or invest in a fixer-upper of their dreams. It’s often a tough call.</p>
<p>There is a notion that older homes have more <em>“character.”</em> However, this character is often accompanied by unexpected costs and a variety of short- and long-term issues that may not have been taken into consideration beforehand. So before you close the deal, read on to find out why buying a new home is often the best choice for home buyers.</p>
<h2>Build the Home of Your Dreams</h2>
<p>Many people “settle” for their home, warts and all. They buy an existing home and convince themselves to live with an awkward kitchen layout, worn porch railings, and tile that doesn’t quite match their personal tastes. After all, it’s something that they reason to themselves that they can fix. But fixing all the problems in that fixer-upper seldom occurs right away, if at all.</p>
<p>That’s the beauty of building and designing your own home - it’s a blank slate. You have the chance to be 100% satisfied when you opt for buying a new home. Even if you don’t build it from scratch, most of the better home builders offer new homes plans that are versatile. Your new home can be shaped according to your specific preferences – countertops, flooring, appliances, cabinets, and even doorknobs can be customized to fit your personality and style.</p>
<h2>Advanced Energy Savings = Advanced Money Savings!</h2>
<p>When buying a home sometimes you need to think like an economist rather than an accountant. While the upfront costs may be slightly higher for a new house, you must always consider the long-term costs. One of the biggest factors in considering long term costs is energy use and general upkeep.  A newly constructed home will use the latest in insulation, including energy efficient appliances, superior high performance windows, water conservation systems, advanced framing techniques and more that aren’t available in homes that at 20+ years old.</p>
<p>Some older homes may seem cheaper at first, but don’t fool yourself - many don’t have the advanced energy saving appliances and systems in place like new homes do. If you want to upgrade an older home to the same energy-saving and water conservation features as a new home, that could easily cost you more than the price of a fully upgraded new home. Always be sure to assess the long-term costs of buying a fixer-upper - it may not be so cheap after all.</p>

<h2><strong>New Home Warranties Save the Day</strong></h2>
<p>When buying a new home, you are also buying some peace of mind. New homes come with a warranty from the builder, and brand new warranties on all your major appliances. If the siding comes loose, the water heater breaks down, etc., you will be covered. Older homes, on the other hand, usually aren’t covered by lengthy or comprehensive warranties. You may get a 1-year warranty on major home system components, but these are typically limited and there are many repairs or replacements that they simply won’t cover.</p>
<p>With any home, things are going to break down and need to be replaced. It’s all a matter of time. There are no guarantees when it comes to older homes – you are inheriting all the existing issues that the previous owners neglected, ignored or were unaware of. As you can imagine, replacing the roof or a HVAC system on an older home a year or two after purchasing can really bite into your wallet!</p>
<p><em>Related: <a href=""http://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/is-a-home-warranty-worth-the-money/"">Is a Home Warranty Worth the Money?</a></em></p>
<h2>New Homes Have Character Too!</h2>
<p>Many people are inspired by the idea of having a craftsman home with quaint decor and classic characteristics that aren’t found as often these days. While it’s true that some architectural feats can’t be matched in today’s construction, you can walk away with a charming and classic home, regardless. With new homes, open floor plans and modern but classic exteriors are the current trend. But keep in mind: the rest is up to you. There’s always ways to personalize your new home.</p>
<p>In fact, homes with a mix of modern and classic architectural elements are often very attention-grabbing and stylish. When you buy a new home, it’s entirely in your hands. You have unlimited freedom to shape the home of your dreams. A new home provides you with a solid, state of the art, advanced and efficient framework - it’s up to you to paint the canvas to have it match the home of your vision.</p>
<h2>In Summary: Buy New!</h2>
<p>To sum up, it’s strongly urged that new homeowners and those looking to move invest in new home construction. The benefits of living in a new energy-efficient home that’s never been lived often outweigh the benefits of buying an older home, and save you money, too.</p>

First time home buyers are especially overwhelmed by this process, which is why we are sharing this info on how to buy your first home. Take a look and see what you need to know about the process of buying your first home.</p>
<h2>12 Month Mark: Prepare to Become a Homeowner</h2>
<p>Every story has a beginning, and this is the beginning of the story of you, the homeowner! A year before you want to move in is the time to take an honest assessment of where you are and where you want to be.</p>
<p><strong>Check your credit score</strong> with one of the three credit bureaus. Not only will this help determine how much you can borrow for your home, it may also show you errors on our credit report that could eventually cost you thousands in higher interest rates.</p>
<p><strong>Determine how much you can comfortably afford</strong> to budget and spend on your new home. Oftentimes you may be able to borrow a higher amount than you may be able to afford so you do need to do some careful budgeting to make sure you are financially comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Make a plan to put together a down payment.</strong> Most mortgages require a 15-20% down payment, but there are programs (such as FHA and VA loans) that allow you to finance a home with less downpayment, some as low as 3 percent. If you are selling assets, borrowing from a relative, or saving monthly, keep in mind that banks want to see that you have stable funds in your account. Plan to have a majority of your down payment in the account 60-90 days prior to applying for a loan.</p>
<h2>9 Month Mark: Home Buying Research</h2>
<p>You have devised a plan for the financial aspects of new home buying, so now it is time to determine what you want in a new home.</p>
<p><strong>Make a list </strong>of all of the wants and needs that you have for your home and prioritize them. Do you want a large kitchen and dining room for entertaining? Do you need a large yard? City, suburbs, or rural? New versus resale? What can you compromise on? Depending on your budget, you may not get everything you want in a home, so by prioritizing your checklist you will know where you can compromise to get your home.</p>
<p><strong>Research neighborhoods</strong>. Are you looking for a new neighborhood, or one of the last few lots in an established neighborhood? Is the school district important to you? Take everything into account including location, proximity to work, distance to shopping and any other elements that you find important.</p>
<p><strong>Start a fund for miscellaneous expenses</strong>. During this time you will want to start a habit of saving money for home maintenance needs. This maintenance fund can also pay for home buying expenses that you may need to pay upfront to make your house complete, such as new lawn mower, washer and dryer, refrigerator, etc. These type expenses can easily cost over a thousand dollars, so it helps to be prepared.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/first-time-home-buyers.jpg"" style=""width: 750px; height: 466px;"" /></p>
<h2>6 Month Mark: Get Ready for a Home Loan</h2>
<p>When you get to this point, it is time to start compiling all of the paperwork that you could possibly need to obtain a home loan. Some documents that you and your partner may need to provide include:</p>
<ul>
<li>W-2/Tax forms for self-employment,</li>
<li>Bank statements,</li>
<li>Recent pay stubs,</li>
<li>2-3 years tax returns,</li>
<li>Credit card and loan statements,</li>
<li>A list of your past addresses,</li>
<li>Retirement and brokerage account statements, and</li>
<li>Any other relevant financial information</li>
</ul>
<p>Collect this information now so you will not have to stress about finding these when it comes time to apply for your loan. This is the ideal time to start considering your lending options and looking for experienced new home salespeople to help you with your home search. It could also be a good idea to look at a mortgage broker instead of an individual lender, as they can be helpful for finding you the best loan option.</p>
<h2>3 Month Mark: Get Pre-Approved for a Home Loan</h2>
<p>Now is the time to start the process of buying a home! You know your budget, you understand your credit, you have your paperwork and are making headway on a down payment.  Now you can get pre-approved for a mortgage! This would give you a good idea of how much you can borrow and the price range for your new home.</p>
<p>After you get pre-approved, you can finally get serious about buying your first home! You’ve done your research on neighborhoods and your priorities, so it’s time to hit the streets. Visit new home models and neighborhoods in your price range. You’ll be delightfully surprised at the prices of new homes compared with resales and rentals. At any budget you may be able to save time and money by working directly with a new home builder, so don’t shy away from new construction with quick move-in specials or even building a home to your specifications! </p>
<h2>2 Month Mark: Make an Offer!</h2>
<p>Once you have found a new home that you love, make an offer. Closing on the house could take 4-8 weeks, meaning that you need to plan some flexibility for your move-in/move-out date.</p>
<h2>Final Month: Ready to be a First Time Homeowner?</h2>
<p>As the last month approaches, you will need to apply for your full mortgage, procure home insurance, provide a cashiers check for closing, and perform a final walk-through and you’re ready to close!</p>
<p>And… that’s it! Now you have finally accomplished your dream of being a first time homeowner!</p>

"2207","2209","Window & Door Trends for 2017","245","1","1493780574","1496316995","1","0","6066","<p>Window and door trends for 2017 are making a departure from the traditional. With more options for design and modern integrations, home owners are making dramatic interior and exterior first impressions with window and door treatments. Homeowners are combining design and function to get the ultimate curb appeal.</p>
<h2>Creating Transitional Spaces</h2>
<p>Doors and windows are no longer a barrier for your home — use them as a bridge. The easiest way to make the most of your space, inside and out, is to make thoughtful design choices. Extend your living areas with wide patio doors that open to the back yard. Create more space out front with screened in porches and windows. Control your space. Break up large areas with sliding walls, which will also allow you to open up your living area for entertaining. Create nooks. Use doors to make instant private work spaces.</p>
<p>Window trends are moving beyond traditional drapery installations. Consider swing arm drapery rods for patio doors or window shutters. Connect with the outdoors with your window treatments. Select window coverings made of bamboo, wood or linen.</p>
<h2>Bolder is Better</h2>
<p>Doors and windows are getting bigger. Larger door sizes – wider than three feet, higher than seven feet make a bold statement. For color, your front door doesn’t need to stick to the traditional red, black, or white. One of the most recent design trends in windows and doors is using found objects and reclaimed wood for entry ways and window casings to give a unique, rich look. Choose floor to ceiling windows to let in maximum light and give your home an open, welcoming feel. Remodeling? Consider replacing an entire wall with glass, or update older windows with stained glass.</p>
<p>If you choose a colorful rather than natural color palette – go bold. Liven up your space with jewel tones, metallic fabrics, and geometric patterns. Adorn simple window treatments with texture like beads, metal accents and eye-catching tiebacks. Be sure to layer your draperies with sheer and opaque fabrics to allow for both light and privacy.</p>
<h2>Contemporary Window & Door Design Trends</h2>
<p>Window and door treatments are moving towards modern profiles and unique applications that combine form, function and style. If you are seeking a home with clean lines and geometric angles, your window treatments require gravity-defying solutions. Try this design trend for angled windows - hang narrow draperies with medallions or hooks along the angle of the windows. If you opt for an arched window, let in more light by forgoing the splash curtain and focus on the windows or doors below. Make room for recessed rods or ceiling tracks to hang curtains, especially if you have opted for shutters or doors that open out into the room.</p>
<h2>Smart Homes? Smart Windows & Doors, Too!</h2>
<p>Many new technology innovations can help you make the most of the light, privacy and temperature controls of your windows and doors. Security features like wireless systems that tell you if windows and doors are locked can give you convenient piece of mind. And unlike traditional security systems, many new wireless systems don’t need to have holes drilled into brand new windows, which is better for energy efficiency. Cordless, automated window treatments are especially important for homes with young children. Keyless entry doors and automated windows are another option for safety and energy efficiency. Open and close windows and doors with the touch of a button. One growing window and door trend is using smart, electrochromic glass that changes the glass from clear to opaque, giving you ultimate control of your light, privacy and temperature. Even between the glass shades can now be controlled via a smart app or remote control.</p>
<h2>One Cool Design Trend: Energy Efficiency</h2>
<p>The desire to save money on heating and cooling and the demand for sustainable construction methods drives many decisions on window and door treatments. While wood framed windows are usually the best choice, except for rainy climates, vinyl can also be an attractive window treatment solution. Well installed vinyl can be just as attractive and sustainable as wood. Vinyl is becoming an even more appealing option, as it now comes in more colors that in the past. Double-paned windows made with Low-E glass, with a vacuum-sealed argon fill are the most requested type of window for energy efficiency. They are especially important for picture windows that don’t open. Triple-paned windows may be more efficient, but they can reduce visibility and light transfer. As for window treatments, shutters give the best savings on energy costs.</p>

"2188","2190","8 Home Safety Tips for Homeowners","245","1","1492788501","1496317703","1","0","5880","<p>According to recent national crime statistics, a home burglary takes place <a href=""https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/figs/crime-clock.jpg"" target=""_blank"">every eighteen seconds</a> in the United States. While there is no way to completely safeguard your home, there are a few simple home safety tips you can take to ward off would-be robbers. Use these tips to protect your home and property:</p>
<h2>1.    Physically Secure Your Home</h2>
<p>Don’t make it easy for robbers to access your home or property. Front and back doors should be equipped with deadbolt locks. If your internal door lock can be accessed by breaking a nearby window, install double cylinder locks on both sides of the door. Glass sliding doors should be secured with pin locks and metal bars on the track. If you leave your windows open at night, open only a few inches to prevent anyone from coming in. Installing locks and motion alarms made specifically for windows can further secure your home. Do not leave ladders and tools out overnight. Besides being easy to steal, robbers can use ladders to break in to the upper stories of your home.</p>
<h2>2.    Use Automatic Lighting with Smart Home Technology</h2>
<p>Whether going on vacation or heading off to work each day, make sure your home maintains a lived-in look. Despite the notion that burglaries happen in the middle of the night, your home is also at risk between the hours of 10 am to 3 pm — when you are most likely to be at work. Inexpensive and easy to install, automatic timers and motion sensors for indoor and outdoor lighting are essential for home security. Be sure to choose timers that have a random mode to keep robbers guessing.</p>
<p>The best long-term solution is to invest in Smart Home technology to control and automate your security system, heating and cooling systems, door locks-even the shades and lighting. Today’s Smart Home technology can allow you to protect your entire home armed with only a smartphone.</p>
<h2>3.    Develop a Home Security Checklist</h2>
<p>Home burglaries happen all year round, but the rate of home break ins drastically rises during the summer months. Open windows, working in the garage, and frequent use of the utility shed can leave your home and belongings at risk. Be sure to secure your residence indoors and out each day. Sit down with your family and discuss home safety tips. Create a checklist to help everyone remember crucial daily security measures.</p>
<h2>4.    Create a Home Security Plan for Your Vacation</h2>
<p>If you are going to be away from home overnight, ask a neighbor to pick up newspapers and mail. Keep a car parked in your driveway or in front of your home if you will be away for more than a couple of days. Never advertise when you will be away from home. While it may be exciting to tell your friends about your upcoming Bahamas trip, beware of what you share online before you go on vacation. Avoid posting travel plans or “checking in” on location-based social media sites.</p>
<h2>5.    Don’t Advertise on Trash Day</h2>
<p>Curbside trash can mark your home as a viable target for theft. Hide any evidence of expensive purchases. Packaging from expensive electronic equipment like televisions and computers should be broken down and placed at the bottom of the recycling pile the night before trash pickup. Lightning can strike twice, so if your home has been broken into, robbers will sometimes wait until valuables are replaced and make another robbery attempt. Don’t advertise the contents of your home while waiting on trash day.</p>
<h2>6.    Invest in a Security System</h2>
<p>When choosing a home security system, get the best you can afford. Make sure it covers the perimeter of your property, especially if you have a storage shed or have items in your back yard like grills, furniture, or recreational vehicles. Many safety and security systems allow you to monitor your home on your cell phone so you can be quickly alerted to a potential burglary. And don’t forget to secure the wiring for your security system. Professional robbers can easily find and disable your system by cutting external wiring.</p>
<h2>7.    Peepholes Help Keep an Eye on Safety</h2>
<p>One overlooked and underestimated home safety tip is a proper peephole on all exterior doors. If your doors do not have windows, install a wide-angle 160° peephole and make sure it is located no higher that 58 inches from the ground. Ask all family members to check the peepholes before answering the door.</p>
<h2>8.    Have a Decoy Box, Just in Case…</h2>
<p>Burglars don’t want to spend a long time in your home searching for valuables. If you have expensive jewelry or cash to protect, consider creating a decoy safe that is easy to find. Hide your real diamond rings in a home safe in the basement, and fill the decoy with fake jewelry and a small amount of cash. If you fall victim to a break in, odds are the robber will grab and go. The best way to protect your family heirlooms and other irreplaceable items? Store them outside your home in a safety deposit box at your bank.</p>
<p><em>The best tool to protect your home is knowledge. Stay aware of your home and your valuables, stay up-to-date on the goings-on in your community, and understand that home security starts with you. If you are searching for a home that utilizes Smart Home technology with security and comfort in mind, then consider</em> <a href=""http://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/cities/greenville-sc/new-homes""><em>new homes for sale in Greenville</em></a><em> from Great Southern Homes.

"2110","2112","Top 5 Home Design Trends for 2017","245","1","1491248482","1496317904","0","0","5611","<p>This year’s hottest home design trends combine modern lifestyles with cozy spaces that make the most of high-tech innovations. From rich interior details to outdoor space planning, today’s homes are the perfect mix of form and function.</p>
<h2>1. Natural Nuances</h2>
<p>Ditch the grey paint and synthetic fabrics, it’s time to bring the outdoors in! Today’s home may be modern, but it’s surely not cold and sterile. Stay on top of today’s interior design trends by warming up your walls with woodsy colors like taupe or deep avocado green. Toss chunky, natural throws on relaxed furniture pieces and accent with jewel toned pillows. Swap out those industrial brushed metal appliances and fixtures for bronze or matte finishes. To complete the look, make a few changes underfoot. Terracotta tiles and jute rugs are popular earthy flooring options.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Cork it! Beautiful and versatile, cork is not only great for floors — try it on walls and tabletops. </p>
<h2>2. Blaze Shifting</h2>
<p>Fireplaces are a major home design trend, but that doesn’t mean you must commit to log splitting and cleaning ashes. Many eco-friendly options are available for those who like to cozy by the hearth. A wood pellet insert burns small lumber byproduct logs that produce less contaminants and burn completely for easier clean up. If you use your fireplace for aesthetics more than large room heating, convert to gas and still enjoy the ambiance of real flames. Use non-functioning fireplaces as a design focal point by lighting candles inside or transforming the space as a curio cabinet or bookshelf.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> No screen time. Find another place to hang your flat screen television. Today’s interior design trends are shifting to use the wall above the mantle for family photos or original pieces of art.</p>
<h2>3. Smart Parts</h2>
<p>Technology is an integral part of modern life. Instead of letting your devices and cords cramp your style, install built-in charging stations into countertops and night stands. Homes are getting “smarter” with digital assistants to help us shop, save energy, and even do laundry. Adding a wireless thermostat can save you hundreds of dollars each year. Keep an eye on your house from anywhere with a digital surveillance system. Try Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Echo home assistants, and never forget the milk again.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Wire up right. Home design trends this year incorporate technology from the initial building stage. Make sure your builder is savvy to the latest trends to accommodate digital lifestyles. </p>
<p><img alt=""Latest Home Design Trends"" src=""/sites/default/files/news/latest-home-design-trends.jpg"" style=""width: 750px; height: 398px;"" /></p>
<h2>4. Flex Space</h2>
<p>Reimagine how you are using your home. Do you need office space, a crafting room, or large kitchen for family gatherings? Even if your home has a traditional floor plan, you can make the most of it. If you work from home, consider a fold-down wall desk. Open space up when not in use by hiding your work area. Dual-duty file cabinets can make for handy organization and attractive plant stands. Old wardrobes can easily be transformed into storage for your latest Pinterest experiment. Create a larger entertaining area by removing a wall between your kitchen and living or dining room.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Buying a new home? It’s all about lifestyle. Consider how you use your free time, let that guide the process.</p>
<h2>5. Healthy Homes</h2>
<p>The approach to both interior and exterior home design has shifted focus from external to internal. Home buyers are less concerned with their carbon footprints, and want their house environment to be less toxic. Gain control over your home health by choosing low or zero volatile organic compound (VOC) paints. Select wood furniture instead of particleboard, which can emit toxins. Make sure your home has plenty of natural light areas, or install UV and LED circadian lighting to boost the brightness. Water filters on faucets and shower heads reduce pollutants – don’t forget the ice maker. Outside, consider if your landscape will require toxic fertilizers and pest control methods. Children’s play areas, especially, should be designed to avoid rubber mulches or areas where pesticide will be used heavily.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Inspect before you buy. Make sure your home inspector looks for contaminants, mold issues, and environmental hazards before you sign on the dotted line.</p>

"2107","2109","Be a Champion of Green Living with a Smart Home","245","1","1490675335","1496835691","0","0","5605","<p>“Smart” devices are so pervasive in our lives that it almost feels like we are living in the future. iPhones and tablet devices are used by young and old alike, and even our cars are fitted with smart devices. It’s about time for our homes to become smart too. State-of-the-art smart home technology isn’t a dream for the future – it is a very present possibility with multiple benefits that you can take advantage of today.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Smart Homes</h2>
<p>Embracing state-of-the-art technologies at home gives you many benefits including convenience, and the savings of time, money and energy. Buying a new smart home or transitioning to smart home technology can improve your control over every aspect of how your house operates, and increase the safety and accessibility of it as well. In addition, you will reap the benefits of a far more efficient home, leading to savings in your energy and upkeep costs!</p>
<p>Here are some of the smart home features that new homes for sale offer:</p>
<h2>Energy Efficient Home Building</h2>
<p>There are a myriad of building techniques that help your home achieve optimal energy efficiency. And when it comes to energy efficiency, you must start at the top! Superior insulation in eco-friendly smart homes can save you thousands on utility bills. An attic with proper R-50+ insulation is proven to be the most crucial aspect of home energy conservation by reducing cooler air escaping through the ceiling. New homes and homes with new roofs that implement radiant barrier roof sheathing also see tremendous savings over time by reflecting shingle heat during warmer months.</p>
<p>But energy efficient home building doesn’t stop at the top. Thermal Envelope Air Sealing ensures less air infiltration throughout the house. Competent builders who are confident in their product will offer a HERS Rating by a third party to ensures minimal air leakage inside the thermal envelope, and give home buyers an accurate measure of the energy efficiency of their new home.</p>
<h2>Modern Temperature Adjustments and Energy Savings</h2>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/Beachphone2.png"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:0px; float:right; height:480px; margin:15px; width:350px"" /></p>
<p>A modern, interconnected programmable thermostat allows you to automatically adjust when you enter or leave your home, saving you money without altering your daily routine. It also allows you to regulate your smart home’s temperature conveniently using your mobile device. Smart thermostats take care of it all, quickly adjusting themselves according to your specific preferences. As a result, you save money while saving precious energy resources. Whether you are using a do-it-yourself system like Nest, or a high-tech full home automation system such as Honeywell’s Tuxedo Touch, you can save time and add convenience using a smart thermostat.</p>
<h2>Safety & Convenience with Smart Appliance and Lighting Controls</h2>
<p>Smart home systems grant you the ability to control lighting and appliances throughout your house. Forget to turn on the lights before you left? No problem. With the tap of your finger you can turn on your home's exterior lights. Away on vacation? Set your lights to turn on and off to match your natural schedule. Not only does a smart lighting solition allow you to make sure lights are off when you are gone to save electricity, it also allows you to turn them on at specific times if you would like it to look like you are home.</p>
<h2>Choosing New Energy Efficient Windows</h2>
<p>The installation of high performance & ""Low E"" windows can have a dramatic affect on your energy consumption. These high-performance windows insulates heat during colder months and reduces and reflects heat in warmer months. Proper window installation and smart home automation can even allow window shades can be opened or closed on a schedule, reducing the need to heat or cool the room and protecting furniture and floors from sun glare.</p>
<h2>Live More “Green” and Save More “<em>Green</em>”</h2>
<p>Green living is often synonymous with energy efficiency. A smart home contributes to the conservation of the earth's limited resources. By using less energy, and wasting less water you lessen your family’s impact on the environment. But if ""going green"" isn't enough to convince you to pursue mart home technology, the financial savings might attract your attention. In a US Environmental Protection Agency study, it was found that users of smart home technology for thermostat control alone saved anywhere from 10%-30% on their energy bill. Over the course of a year, or 5 years, those savings add up quickly.</p>
<p>Not only do smart home improvements save on your monthly bill payments, the resale value of your home increases with each addition of these technologies. Most home buyers rate energy efficiency as an important factor in their home purchase.</p>

"2087","2089","Moving Day Tips: A Relocation Survival Guide","240","1","1489636356","1489565410","0","0","5137","<div style=""text-align:justify;"">
<p>Navigating the chaos of work/life schedules can be tough on an average day. When you imagine relocating your family and all of your belongings to a new home, moving day can feel insurmountable.</p>
<p>While moving day will obviously have some stressors beyond your control, there are a number of steps you can take ahead of time to avoid moving day mistakes and ensure the process goes smoothly.</p>
<p>Here are some helpful Moving Day Tips to make your relocation an easy and enjoyable experience.</p>
<h2>Research Your Moving Company</h2>
<p>Chances are that you will need the assistance of a moving company during your relocation. There are a myriad of local and national moving companies to choose from, however, not all movers are equal.</p>
<p>More than 30 million Americans relocate each year, and almost 30% unknowingly hire disreputable moving companies and end up with horror stories of botched schedules and broken or missing belongings.</p>
<p>Troublesome issues can be avoided with a little research before you choose a moving company. Read online reviews. Ask friends and neighbors who have moved recently. Poll people in the checkout line at the grocery store. Make sure that the company you hire has bonded workers and is in good standing with the Better Business Bureau. You can even ask potential moving companies for references from their previous clients. And don’t always settle for the least expensive option - sometimes you need to pay for quality.</p>
<h2>Prepare A Packing Schedule</h2>
<p>A crucial moving day tip is to pack your belongings far ahead of time, and leave nothing for the final day. Beginning the packing process early will allow you to avoid the most common moving day mistakes.</p>
<p>The ""I can pack up everything in a day or two"" mindset will land you in trouble if you do not start early. To avoid hassles on the final day make sure that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a packing schedule / timeline and adhere to it. No excuses.</li>
<li>Start packing as soon as your move is confirmed,</li>
<li>Collect all of your packing materials in advance. Running back and forth to the store wastes valuable time and can kill motivation.</li>
<li>Ask friends and relatives to help. Extra pairs of hands are always a good thing.</li>
<li>If you feel overwhelmed doing this by yourself, call the your movers and inquire about packing options. It may be that they can take care of the tedious portions of packing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pack Your Overnight Bag</h2>
<p>For your relocation to run smoothly, you want to be confident, organized and prepared for anything. Clean teeth and fresh underwear can help you keep your sanity when moving, especially when moving day doesn’t go according to plans. A key piece of moving day advice is to pack an ""overnight bag"" or a ""survival kit"" to carry with you on the day of the move. After a long and a tiring day, you certainly won't feel like unpacking all the boxes at your new home. And if your movers are delayed, you don’t want to be uncomfortable and rushed. At such times, an overnight bag is sure to come handy for you and your family.</p>
<p>Pack items such as toiletries, medicine, a few extra pairs of clothes, some toys if you have kids, and other necessary items which are a part of your daily activities. It may also be wise to include a few other must-haves like phone chargers, a tablet or laptop, scissors and other simple tools, a flashlight, your address book, and other essentials. Also, remember to have some cash on hand, just in case, so you can pay for snacks, drinks and extra supplies. Be prepared!</p>
<h2>Using A Moving Day Checklist</h2>
<p>Your mover will present you with a ""Bill of Lading"" before or on the day of your move. This document is a detailed inventory of your items to be loaded and moved. Confirm the items listed and double-check that the document is correct. Be very careful to check the destination address and that your phone numbers are clearly printed on the document. Verify all of the details. Cross-check their estimate sheet against your copy, and inquire about delivery time frame just in case the move takes more time than expected. When you feel confident that everything is accounted for, sign the bill of lading and keep your copies in a safe place.</p>
<p>Supervise moving day from the moment the movers arrive at your new home. Check the list once before leaving your old home and once again as all the items get unloaded at your new place. It is better to be safe than sorry. Call out any delicate items that need careful handling. Feel free to direct traffic when the movers reach your new home. But be reasonable - stay out of the way and let the movers do their jobs. Try to check the inventory the day of arrival so you will know if items have gone missing or are damaged.</p>
<h2>Have Patience</h2>
<p>Despite excellent planning and valiant attempts to keep everything on schedule, chances are there will be slight delays or some minor crisis moments on the big day. Even when you have followed most of the tips for moving day, there will be events beyond your control. Losing your cool, raising your voice, or getting emotional will not help anyone's day. Keep a level head and be considerate of your family and your movers. Avoid unnecessary stress at all costs. Try to keep the mood light and make moving day a happy memory. For better or worse, this is your first adventure in your new home - the first page in a new chapter of your life.</p>

<p>Here are a few tips which will help you organize your home quickly and quite easily as well.</p>
<h2><strong>Start with a Schedule</strong></h2>
<p>Before you jump into the ""Let me clean the entire house today"" phase, take time to plan out the task as you would any other important event in your life. You do not want to be rushed, cleaning your home when you have company coming in two hours. Schedule your de-cluttering on a day when you are free, with two or three hours to spare. You probably want a few more pairs of hands to help you declutter your home depending on how much you have planned to clean up on that day. Though the job might look quite easy to handle, it is always better if there are spouses, significant others, and even children to help out as well.</p>
<h2><strong>Where To Start?</strong></h2>
<p>When organizing your home, it is always better to start with the most overcrowded or the most cluttered place in the house. And that is bound to be your garage. From the smallest of tools to the unwanted chair from your last move, everything is bound to be stocked up in your garage.</p>
<p>To make the de-cluttering in your garage a lot easier, here are some simple inexpensive tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a peg board with some hook tools for all of your tools.</li>
<li>Do you really need that furniture stored in the garage? If it is not of any use, just get rid of it permanently.</li>
<li>Make it a habit to not throw unwanted items into your garage. Determine if you can make use of it elsewhere, and if not, get rid of it!</li>
<li>Reserve some room in your garage for donations. Make donating unwanted items to the Salvation Army, Goodwill or other charities part of your weekly errands.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The Closets</strong></h2>
<p>When organizing your home, the next place you need to check out right after the garage is your closet. Bulging closets are nothing short of a nightmare. But cleaning out your closet is a very easy thing to do as once the entire space is cleared all you need to do is find what fits you and what doesn't. And for all the clothes of your kids, a hanging shelving unit is your best option. Small labels for each day of the week, and picking out clothes for the following week on a weekend are some little perks which will help you in your Home Organization.</p>
<h2><strong>The Toy Story</strong></h2>
<p>Tripping on toy cars or stepping on Legos are universal annoyances. The best way to deal with this is to make the ""put your toys away"" task for your kids interesting and exciting. It is very important that you teach your kids the significance of an organized home, and you can do it the fun way.</p>
<p>One way you can do this is make use of various colored bins to hold different types of toys. Have a game with your children to find out who puts the most toys in their respective bins. The more interesting and playful it is for your kids, the more they will be keen on their personal “Home Organization” activity.</p>
<h2><strong>Maintenance</strong></h2>
<p>All the trouble that you take in organizing your <strong><a href=""http://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/"">new home</a></strong> goes down the drain if you do not maintain what you have organized. Most people find home organization difficult to maintain after a few weeks. It is very important to develop personal daily habits that allow you to remain organized. One such example is to take 10-20 minutes out of your busy day just to keep items off the floor, or to make your beds. This practice not only helps declutter your home on a regular basis, but also helps you maintain a decluttered home for a long time.</p>
<p>Decluttering your home is an easy task if you organize it well and make sure that you follow up on a regular basis. Keep in mind that regularly making time for home organization will save your hours of time in the long-run.</p>

"2036","2037","5 Critical Questions To Ask When Buying A New Home","245","1","1488204192","1500380729","0","0","4864","<div style=""text-align:justify;"">
<p>Buying a new home offers a fresh start in your life. To make sure that your fresh start is a smart move, it is important to do a little bit of research. <br />
What questions do you need to ask when buying a new home? Read on.</p>
<h2><strong>Is a Home Warranty offered? Do I need one?</strong></h2>
<p>When buying a new home there are the obvious costs – the home, insurance, upgrades and alterations. But there are hidden costs as well. A home warranty can help save you money in the short- and long-term and give you peace of mind.</p>
<p>A home warranty is a service contract that covers the repair or replacement of important home system components and appliances that break down over time. Breakdowns are inevitable – home system components and appliances simply wear out over time.</p>
<p>Great Southern Homes are sold with the finest warranty service programs available. We back each new home we build with a 10-year Structural Warranty. Every home we build is also covered by a 1-year Builder Warranty and a 2-year Limited Mechanical Warranty. During this time, our in-house warranty and customer service department is available to help resolve any problems that may arise with your home.</p>
<p>Read More about the <strong><a href=""http://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/warranty"">Great Southern Homes Home Warranty Program</a></strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>What are the long-term plans for the community?</strong></h2>
<p>There is a very high probability that your new home is part of a new community. Before you buy a new home, make sure that you ask your builder or agent whether all the properties have been built or are there any more planned for the future? Your community should have a master plan, and you should rest assured that your planned community will continue as planned.</p>
<p>Great Southern Homes has built over 5,000 homes over the last 20 years. We know how to plan communities the right way, and we are always happy to share our vision for your future neighborhood.</p>
<h2><strong>Can I talk to few of your past clients?</strong></h2>
<p>Reference and reviews are the most useful information when you want to buy a new home. Ask the past clients of the home builder questions regarding the nature of the builder and an account for the builder's responsive nature.</p>
<p>Great Southern Homes is proud of the relationships we have forged with our homeowners, and we will gladly put potential customers in touch with other satisfied customers.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/contact-us"">Contact Great Southern Homes</a></strong> for references.</p>
<h2><strong>Are there any HOA Rules & Regulations? </strong></h2>
<p>When buying a new home, you should keep in mind that each HOA has its own Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions and bylaws. Make sure that you get these from your builder and review them carefully. There are numerous cases where HOAs do not allow certain inclusions such as storage sheds, solar panels or even private fences in a few cases. And the HOA can even assess a homeowner penalty for infractions of such infractions of the rules.</p>
<p>Great Southern Homes is happy to will walk you through the ins and outs of your new neighborhood at any time.</p>
<h2><strong>How Energy Efficient is my new home?</strong></h2>
<p>Saving energy means saving money. Many home builders say that their homes are energy efficient, but they only do a fraction of what they should to build energy-efficient homes the right way. At Great Southern Homes we believe that energy efficiency is a priority for every new home. It saves money and simply makes sense. That’s why we created our own energy efficiency program: <strong><a href=""http://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/greensmart-homes"">GreenSmart Homes</a>.</strong></p>
<p>A GreenSmart Home uses state-of-the-art technology to make your house smart and energy efficient. Live Green. Live Smart.</p>
<p><em>If you are in the market for a new home, you have got a lot of options. The sales of new homes have surged in the recent years, and new residential constructions are at the peak right now. But your new home can be a perfect choice only when you know how to deal with the market and what to look for. If you are hunting for <strong><a href=""http://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/cities/columbia"">new homes in Columbia</a></strong>, your search ends with Great Southern Homes</em>.</p>

<p>The Laurel is an impressive, craftsman-style, two-story home that combines great living space in a small footprint.  Imagine three bedrooms, two full baths and a half bath, single-car garage – all contained in 1,612 square feet! Young families, first time buyers, Millennials and professional couples are drawn to this layout where every foot of space counts.  Regarding street appeal, The Laurel offers neo-traditional flair with a mix of stone, brick and/or vinyl treatments. The covered entranceway/porch showcases impressive entrance doors with full windows and transoms. Buyers enjoy the recessed, split stairs where typically in this size home they crowd the front door. Entrance from the garage provides buyers with a clever “drop zone” with built-ins to off-load: keys, garments, and other baggage that tend to clutter up the house.  The rear is a huge open space with Living Area and optional fireplace, Dining and Kitchen areas with a large angled Kitchen Island overlooking the Living Area.  A spacious patio in the rear provides homeowners a great place to enjoy the outdoors and entertain.  Moving upstairs, The Laurel offers an impressive Owners Suite with Walk-In Closets, and double vanities in the Owners Bath area. Two additional bedrooms with nice sized closets are provided and the other Full Bath provides double vanities and a large tub.  Plus, there is a large laundry room upstairs and lots of additional storage closets to store and keep essentials.

<strong>The Magnolia - <a href=""http://www.greatsouthernhomes.com/floorplans/magnolia"">View Floorplan</a></strong><br />
<strong>2201 to 2600 Square Feet - Production Builder</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""The Magnolia by Great Southern Homes"" src=""/sites/default/files/styles/news_images/public/magnolia-ext-int.jpg"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto;"" /></p>
<p>The Magnolia is a single-story, four bedroom / three bath, two-car garage plan with lots of “WOW” factor that appeals to multiple fast-growing market segments.  The Magnolia appeals to rising tide of Baby Boomers who are retiring/pre-retiring and ready to downsize. At under 2,500 square feet and with Great Southern Homes’ GreenSmart energy-efficient program, the plan just makes sense for Boomers to move to.  There’s plenty of room to entertain and host the grandkids in this grand design. Move-up buyers enjoy the incredible openness of the plan and the many features of interior treatments, built-ins and granite countertops that Great Southern builds into it.  The Magnolia offers a sitting porch on the front of the home and in most markets is offered with either brick, cementitious siding or higher-quality vinyl exteriors.  A tour of the home reveals a formal foyer with hardwoods and elegant formal dining with optional coffered ceiling. The massive Great Room and Cook’s Kitchen connect the entire house together and lead to the large covered patio in the rear of the home.  The Kitchen features an optional window seat, a nice accent, but a very large eat-up bar and kitchen island that overlooks the Great Room are standard. An optional wetbar or organizational center within the Great Room is also a popular upgrade. The Magnolia is the preferred choice among many as more and more are choosing single-story plans and this model packs so much into one house, yet impresses on how open it is. </p>

<p><strong>2016 Best Advertising Video</strong><br />
<strong>Customer Testimonial</strong></p>
<p>Research shows that when someone trusted says something positive or negative about a product or service to another person, the receiver of the message usually does what the influencer says to do. Testimonials, referrals, brand loyalty – all are part of this big intangible called “word of mouth.” You can’t buy positive testimonials. In business, you have to earn them!</p>
<p>Great Southern Homes wanted to start a new television advertising campaign that focused on testimonials of real buyers of their homes and ask them to give their honest feelings about why they bought their homes. We wanted the people to be real buyers not paid actors and the testimonials to be real and persuasive.</p>
<p>The process started with our creative team and identifying the steps necessary to complete the project. First was to identify the possible interview candidates. A long list was generated by asking for names of candidates from our sales, construction and closing teams.  Next, we contacted candidates on the list to see if they would participate. We explained that we wanted them to attend a photoshoot and for them to honestly respond to some questions about their purchase of a Great Southern Home. Most declined because even though they enjoyed their home, they did not want to appear on TV, they were too busy or work or family interfered. </p>
<p>Three candidates were finally identified and we arranged to film them at either their home or at the nearest model home to their address. The three that agreed to participate were a single, professional woman, a husband and wife “move-up” pair, and military wife who relocated to the market with several kids and husband who was often deployed.</p>
<p>We set up, attached a mic, prepped the candidates and began the interview process which usually took an hour.  The questions were very open-ended such as “tell us why you purchased your Great Southern Homes?” and “What do you like about your home?” to get them comfortable and talking. Magically, in all three cases, great, positive statements rolled out of candidates such as, “great home,” “would do it again”, “Iove my house”, “love my realtor”, “the process was great”, “I love that I can turn off the lights from my phone”, etc.</p>
<p>The value of the testimonial TV advertisement is that it puts a real face saying real, believable and positive statements about our homes to a wide audience.  And you just can’t buy that!</p>

Guglielmone will dedicate St. Sebastian Stadium and The Nieri Family Field House at halftime of this Friday’s football game, which is slated to kick off at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p><p>Named after the patron saint of athletes, St. Sebastian Stadium features a “Celebration Bermuda Turf” Field, seating for 1,000, a press box and home and visitor concession stands. This wonderful addition to the campus was donated by the Robert Leichtle family.</p>
<p><p>“We sent two children to Cardinal Newman in the mid and late ’90s,” said Bob and Ann Leichtle. “They received an outstanding education in a great environment. Both played multiple sports each year, participated in student government and made friends for life. When we heard the initial plans to hopefully build a new, larger, modern CN with all athletics on campus, we wanted to help make it a reality and not just a dream. We have one grandchild attending CN now and at least four more heading there. We want them and all other students desiring a great education and athletic opportunities in a Christian environment where God and prayer are allowed to be able to do so.”</p>
<p><p>The Nieri Family Field House, donated by The Michael Nieri Family, will also be dedicated. The field house is a 7,500 square foot facility that supports athletics with home and visitor locker rooms, an athletic weight room, an athletic trainer center and a wrestling and cheerleading room. “After seeing what an enriching environment my children experienced with a smaller, tighter knit group of like-minded children and families, I felt compelled to further the cause and continue with the vision that was put together by a group of my peers,” said Michael Nieri. “Athletics were a huge part of my kids’ success while attending Cardinal Newman, and some day my grandchildren may have the benefit of the new facility and athletic venues. In the mean time, many young student athletes will enjoy these state-of- the-art facilities. I’m glad that our family could be part of this new campus!”</p>
<p><p>“Our athletic director, coaches and I are extremely grateful to the Leichtle and Nieri families for their generous support of our student athletes,” said Principal Jacqualine Kasprowski. “These state-of- the-art enhancements to our new campus will enable us to achieve our mission of promoting athletic EXCELLENCE in everything we do.”</p>

Builder Magazine reports that last year Great Southern Homes achieved over $100 million in new homes closed with 544 unit closings. Moreover, Great Southern Homes was recognized in a feature article by the noted magazine as the 6th Fastest-Growing Private Builder in the nation having grown from 386 home closings in 2014 to 544 home closings in 2015, an impressive year-over-year increase of 41%.</p>

In addition to the Builder Magazine recognitions as the 74th largest builder in the nation and the 6th fastest-growing private builder, the company recently achieved the milestones of building and closing its 5,000th home, passing the $100 million mark in sales, and recognition as the largest home builder in the Midlands of South Carolina for 2015 as measured by permits and closings. As it continues to grow, Great Southern Homes is expanding into other rising housing markets within the Carolinas and Georgia and plans to build over 1,000 homes this year.</p>

Through the first quarter 2016, Great Southern Homes sold 273 homes ($50 million in sales) and is on pace to sell over 1,000 homes this year in South Carolina. This would be the third year in a row the company has grown sales by over 40%. “It is rare that a homebuilder builds and sells over 100 homes per month and grows by over 40% year over year. Great Southern Homes has been on an impressive growth surge that uses volume production strategies while maintaining quality and managing costs” notes Earl McLeod, Executive Director of the Building Industry Association of Central South Carolina. “I believe their ‘secret sauce’ is they build great homes with innovative floor plans and they commit to putting homes on the ground where there is demand both in terms of market and price.”</p>
<p><p>In the same week, Great Southern Homes achieved the milestone of 100 homes per month, it also reached the significant benchmark of selling its 5,000th home since opening doors in 1993. The company plans to celebrate this impressive feat with a festive celebration later this month for the general real estate community.</p>
<p><p>Michael P. Nieri, Owner/Founder of Great Southern Homes commented, “It took me 20 years to build 5,000 homes. Now we have a company that is on sure footing to grow tenfold in the next twenty years and keep growing thereafter. My plan is that in the next two decades, my kids will build record numbers of homes and my hope is my grandkids in their lifetime will build half a million! Watch us grow!”</p>
<p><p>Last year, 330 different real estate agents from 141 real estate companies participated in selling the company’s homes throughout South Carolina. In fact, over 85% of the company’s homes are sold by participating real estate agents demonstrating the importance of the agent network to the success of Great Southern Homes.</p>
<p><p>“The reason we hit these impressive sales numbers is because of our outside, participating agents. They are the heart and soul of our business and we must give credit where credit is due,” Nieri stated.</p>
